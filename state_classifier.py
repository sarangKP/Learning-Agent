Layer 2 — State Classifier

Affect states: frustrated | confused | sad | calm | disengaged

Four input signals:
  sentiment_score  : VADER compound       (-1 to +1)
  repetition_score : TF-IDF cosine        (0 to 1)
  confusion_score  : confusion keywords   (0 to 1)
  sadness_score    : sadness keywords     (0 to 1)

Decision priority (checked top to bottom, first match wins):
  frustrated   : strong negative + repetition  → needs clarity + pace + patience
  confused     : confusion keywords or repetition → needs clarity + confirmation
  sad          : sadness keywords (no confusion) → needs patience + empathy only
  disengaged   : very short / minimal input with neutral/no signal → needs re-engagement
  calm         : none of the above

── Escalation Smoother ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
After the raw affect is determined, apply_escalation_rules() inspects the
rolling affect_window (last N classifications sent by the caller) and may
downgrade the raw affect if the evidence is insufficient to justify a sudden
jump.

The core principle: affect should escalate gradually.
  calm → confused → frustrated    ✓  (one step at a time)
  calm → frustrated               ✗  (skip-level jump — needs very strong evidence)

Rules (checked in order, first match wins):

  Frustrated rules:
    R3  all_calm_history
        If every entry in the window is calm, frustrated is downgraded to
        confused regardless of signal strength.

    R1  insufficient_streak
        Frustrated is only allowed to stand if the window ends with at least
        MIN_NONCALM_STREAK (2) consecutive non-calm entries. A single non-calm
        turn is always suppressed; two or more consecutive non-calm turns means
        the escalation is genuine and earned.
        all_signals_fired bypasses this so genuine multi-signal frustration
        can still escalate even from a short streak.

  Disengaged rule:
    R4  disengaged_calm_history
        FIX: disengaged can fire on any very short message (≤3 words) even
        after an entirely calm history — e.g. "Yes." or "Okay." said by a
        user who is simply being brief. This false positive then trains the
        bandit on a spurious disengaged state.
        If the window is entirely calm and the raw affect is disengaged,
        downgrade to calm. A genuinely disengaged user will show a pattern
        of short messages across multiple turns; a single short message
        after calm history is more likely brevity than disengagement.

These rules are additive dampeners — they never upgrade an affect, only
downgrade it. The full multi-signal frustrated path (negative + repetition +
strong keywords) bypasses R1 so genuine sustained frustration is still caught.

── affect_window validation ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
FIX: the escalation smoother trusted the caller to send valid affect strings.
A malformed window (typo, wrong length, stale data) silently produced
incorrect escalation decisions because unknown strings would never match
"calm", making the all-calm guard unreliable.
Now any unrecognised entry is stripped with a warning before the window is
used. The original list is never mutated.
